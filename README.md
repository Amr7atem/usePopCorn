# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Responsive styling added ✅

I added a mobile-first responsive stylesheet and updated component paint points so the UI works well across viewport sizes. Here are the main changes and how to test them locally:

- Breakpoints used: 600px, 900px, 1200px
- Main layout switches to a single-column flow on small viewports and two-column boxes on medium/large screens.
- Nav bar stacks items on small screens and returns to a 3-column layout on wider viewports.
- Movie detail header switches from column (mobile) to row (desktop) so poster and overview display side-by-side.
- The rating component now supports size via a CSS variable (`--star-size`) which allows responsive adjustments.

How to test locally:

1. Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

2. Open http://localhost:3000 and resize the browser (or use your device toolbar in devtools) to check the responsiveness at different widths (mobile/tablet/desktop).

If you want any tweaks to breakpoints or a different mobile/desktop layout, tell me which screens to prioritize and I can refine the design.
